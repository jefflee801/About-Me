<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Currenlty, I'm working as a Financial Analyst. I have spent the last eight years working in the finance departments of Overstock.com, The Royal Bank of Scotland and Genesys Telecommunications. In that time I have learned that finance/accounting is boring. It's time for a change! Time to learn something new, get a sweet new job and justify buying this computer!</p>
